## Henrique Medeiros 👋

Hi there! I’m a software engineer passionate about building reliable applications and helping teams modernize their codebases.

🖥️ I work mostly with Ruby on Rails, working on Rails upgrade projects that keep companies’ applications secure, maintainable, and future-proof.

✍️ [I also write technical articles for the FastRuby.io blog](https://www.fastruby.io/blog/authors/hmdros)
, sharing insights on upgrades, performance, and best practices in the Ruby and Rails ecosystem.

🔭 Currently, I’m part of the[ OmbuLabs
 team](https://www.ombulabs.com/), where I contribute to consulting projects and open source initiatives in the Rails community.

🌱 I’m studying performance improvements, and exploring how AI tools and Python frameworks can integrate with web development workflows.

⚙️ In the past, I’ve worked with JavaScript (Node.js, React, React Native) and have hands-on experience with Redis, SQL databases, Docker, and Kubernetes.

💡 Always curious about solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code — and sharing knowledge along the way.
